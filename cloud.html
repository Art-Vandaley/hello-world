    <h1>Cloud computing</h1>
    <p>
      Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system
      resources, especially data storage (cloud storage) and computing power,
      without direct active management by the user. The term is generally used
      to describe data centers available to many users over the Internet. Large
      clouds, predominant today, often have functions distributed over multiple
      locations from central servers. If the connection to the user is
      relatively close, it may be designated an edge server.
    </p>

    <p>
      Clouds may be limited to a single organization (enterprise clouds<a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a><a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a>),
      or be available to many organizations (public cloud).
    </p>

    <p>
      Cloud computing relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and
      economies of scale.
    </p>

    <p>
      Advocates of public and hybrid clouds note that cloud computing allows
      companies to avoid or minimize up-front IT infrastructure costs.
      Proponents also claim that cloud computing allows enterprises to get their
      applications up and running faster, with improved manageability and less
      maintenance, and that it enables IT teams to more rapidly adjust resources
      to meet fluctuating and unpredictable demand,<a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a><a href="#footnote-3">[3]</a><a href="#footnote-4">[4]</a> providing the burst
      computing capability: high computing power at certain periods of peak
      demand.<a href="#footnote-5">[5]</a>
    </p>

    <p>
      Cloud providers typically use a "pay-as-you-go" model, which can lead to
      unexpected operating expenses if administrators are not familiarized with
      cloud-pricing models.<a href="#footnote-6">[6]</a>
    </p>

    <p>
      The availability of high-capacity networks, low-cost computers and storage
      devices as well as the widespread adoption of hardware virtualization,
      service-oriented architecture and autonomic and utility computing has led
      to growth in cloud computing.<a href="#footnote-7">[7]</a><a href="#footnote-8">[8]</a><a href="#footnote-9">[9]</a> By 2019, Linux was the most widely
      used operating system, including in Microsoft's offerings and is thus
      described as dominant.<a href="#footnote-10">[10]</a> The Cloud Service Provider (CSP) will screen,
      keep up and gather data about the firewalls, intrusion identification
      or/and counteractive action frameworks and information stream inside the
      network.<a href="#footnote-11">[11]</a>
