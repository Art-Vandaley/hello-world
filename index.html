        <p>
          Edge computing is a distributed computing paradigm that brings
          computation and data storage closer to the location where it is
          needed, to improve response times and save bandwidth. The origins of
          edge computing lie in content delivery networks that were created in
          the late 1990s to serve web and video content from edge servers that
          were deployed close to users. In the early 2000s, these networks
          evolved to host applications and application components at the edge
          servers,<a href="#footnote-3">[3]</a> resulting in the first commercial edge computing
          services<a href="#footnote-4">[4]</a> that hosted applications such as dealer locators, shopping
          carts, real-time data aggregators, and ad insertion engines. Modern
          edge computing significantly extends this approach through
          virtualization technology that makes it easier to deploy and run a
          wider range of applications on the edge servers.

        <p>
          Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system
          resources, especially data storage (cloud storage) and computing
          power, without direct active management by the user. The term is
          generally used to describe data centers available to many users over
          the Internet. Large clouds, predominant today, often have functions
          distributed over multiple locations from central servers. If the
          connection to the user is relatively close, it may be designated an
          edge server.
